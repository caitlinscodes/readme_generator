# Caitlin Stevenson|README Generator Assignment

## Objectives

In this project, I created a program that allows the user to create a new README file by answering prompts in their terminal. The project uses node modules, and requires the inquirer and fs packages. Once the user has answered all of the prompted questions a README file will automatically be generated using the prompt responses.
